Can you explain about Device Functional Modes,"The device mentioned in the context has different functional modes. These modes determine how the device operates under different conditions. The transition between these modes is automatic and based on the circuits that are active and required. The device can operate in three power states: Active, Idle, or Sleep. The Modern Standby mode is a special case of the Idle mode. The functionality available in each state is summarized in Table 9-6. Additionally, there is a SafeMode where the device does not enable the sink path and USB PD is disabled until a configuration is loaded. The configuration can be loaded from an external EEPROM or an external host. The exact details of how to configure the device in each mode can be found in the provided documentation.",,,2023-12-01 18:09:46.194871
